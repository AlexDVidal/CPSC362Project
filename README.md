Main project for CPSC361, Software Engineering. This project is to create a program capable of encoding and decoding
information using various historical algorithms like the Enigma Cipher or Vignere Cipher. There will be a frontend 
graphically displaying what is occuring in each of the ciphers as plain text is encoded or ciphertext decoded.
